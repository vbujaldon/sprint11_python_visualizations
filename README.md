# Sprint 11 — Python Visualizations & Power BI Integration

## Description

This repository contains the practical exercises developed for **Sprint 11 – Data Visualization with Python**, focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques using Python and their integration into **Power BI**.

The project covers the complete analytical workflow:

* Connection to a **MySQL database**
* Data extraction and transformation with **Pandas**
* Creation of statistical visualizations using:

  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Plotly
* Interpretation of analytical results
* Integration of Python visualizations into **Power BI dashboards**

The dataset used corresponds to the transactional database created in **Sprint 4**.

---

## General Objectives

* Understand the main data visualization methodologies.
* Select appropriate visualization techniques depending on data type and analytical objective.
* Work with both **static** and **interactive** visualizations in Python.
* Integrate analytical workflows across **MySQL, Python and Power BI**.

---

## Specific Objectives

* Create basic visualizations using Pandas.
* Apply visualization libraries such as:

  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Plotly
* Analyse relationships between numerical and categorical variables.
* Implement visual analytics pipelines combining databases and BI tools.
* Transfer Python visualizations into Power BI using Python scripts.

## Exercises Overview

### Level 1 — Exploratory Visualizations

Connection between Python and MySQL Workbench and creation of visualizations for:

* One numerical variable
* Two numerical variables
* One categorical variable
* Numerical vs categorical variable
* Two categorical variables
* Three combined variables
* Pairplot analysis

Each visualization includes interpretation of results.

---

### Level 2 — Relationship Analysis

* Correlation analysis between selected variables.
* Jointplot implementation to analyse variable dependency and distribution.

---

### Level 3 — Power BI Integration

All Level 1 visualizations are recreated inside **Power BI** using Python scripts.

⚠️ Special consideration:
When importing datasets into Power BI, unique identifiers were included to prevent automatic duplicate removal.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* MySQL Workbench
* Power BI Desktop
* Jupyter Notebook
* VS Code

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* Data extraction from relational databases
* Data wrangling and aggregation
* Statistical visualization
* Regression and correlation analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Python–Power BI integration
* Analytical interpretation of visual outputs
